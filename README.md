### ⚠️ Project Status: Active R&D

**Axiom is currently under active reconstruction.** We are evolving the architecture from the experimental NG phase into a stable Rust-based core.
_Current benchmarks: 304K events/sec (Rust Core)._

---

### Core Philosophy

Axiom is designed as a cognitive computing platform combining:

- **Performance:** Rust backend for event processing (0.39μs latency).
- **Flexibility:** Python/Jupyter interface for high-level logic and experimentation.
- **Connectivity:** Real-time WebSocket API.

### Support

Research and creation of Axiom.
